               <h4>Introduction</h4>
               <p>The Davis Computational Spectroscopy (DCS) projects aims to simplify the process of predicting a
                    spectrum. This is DCS Discover, a database of inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra computed
                    and measured as well as the crystal structures of each material. Our other work, <a class="text-info" href="#">DCS
                         flow</a>, is a computational workflow that allows researchers to compute INS, Raman, and
                    infrared (IR) spectra from a crystal strucutre. Many of the computed spectra in this database were
                    computed using DCS flow. This database makes it easy to compare computed and experimental INS
                    spectra for a number of organic materials.</p>
               <p>Phonons, or atomic vibrations, are responsible for a number of processes within OSCs. Because
                    small-molecule OSCs are weakly bound by Van der Waals forces, charges transport is largely affected
                    by the phonons. Thus an accurate description of phonon modes is necessary to understand charge
                    transport. Similarly, heat transport is also largely dependent on the phonon modes. In both cases,
                    the best way to verify the computed phonon modes' accuracy is to compare to an INS spectrum. This is
                    becasue INS can measure more phonon modes directly than any other experimental technique.</p>
               <p>When it comes to predicting the phonon modes, quantum calculations must be performed. These are
                    typically computationally costly DFT simulations. Many of the spectra in this database, however were
                    computed using DFTB+, a tight-binding approximation to DFT. In addition, DFTB+ with a ChIMES
                    correction was also employed. This correction improves the DFTB+ phonon predictions without adding
                    significant computational cost. The spectra in this database demonstrate that in many cases DFTB+ or
                    DFTB+ with ChIMES is sufficient to produce an accurate description of the phonon modes.</p>
               <p>What follows is a much more in-depth description of charge transport in organic semiconductors, INS
                    spectroscopy, and how to compute INS spectra. For more information about DCS Flow, our simple method
                    for computing INS, Raman, and IR spectra, please visit our <a class="text-info" href="#">documentation website</a> for

               <h4 id="intro">Organic Electronics</h1>
                    <p>OSCs are materials which have an alternating single-double carbon bond (Fig 1). This pattern
                         causes charge delocalization along the alternating chain, leading to charge transport. Within
                         the class of OSCs, there are two main types: polymers and small-molecules. In polymers, long
                         conjugated chains form a backbone for charge to travel along; side chains extend from the back
                         bone. These materials generally form regions of relative crystallinity and other regions which
                         are amorphous. Polymers are difficult to simulate accurately due to their large size and
                         complex morphology. The other category of organic semiconductor is the small-molecule type.
                         Small-molecule semiconductors generally have a series of conjugated rings along with side
                         chains. They consist of roughly 100 atoms and form a highly-ordered molecular lattice. These
                         materials are much simpler to simulate due to their smaller size and basic morphology.

                    <p>Both the hopping model and band theory fail to describe charge transport in small-molecule OSCs.
                         This is because the basic assumptions of each model do not apply to organic small-molecule
                         materials.<sup>1</sup> Band theory assumes a highly ordered material in which the lattice sites
                         are stationary. In small-molecule OSCs, however, the molecules are constantly moving.
                         At a given snapshot, the molecules would appear disordered. The
                         hopping model also fails because although the molecules are disordered at an instant, the
                         hopping model cannot accommodate dynamic disorder. Furthermore, experimental studies have shown
                         both band-like temperature dependence and localized charges which are irreconcilable with
                         both theories.<sup>2</sup> Thus, a new model was needed to describe charge transport in these
                         materials.</p>

                    <p>Transient localization theory (TLT) was developed by Ciuchi, Fratini, and Mayou in
                         2011.<sup>3</sup> It begins with the Hamiltonian for electron transfer modulated by a molecular
                         vibration with a frequency \(\omega_0\). The Hamiltonian will
                         not be written here as it is beyond the scope of this discussion, but the results of this
                         formulation
                         will be discussed briefly. At times \(t<\frac{1}{\omega_0}\), the wavefunction remains
                              localized. However, at longer times localization is destroyed and diffusion-like transport
                              dominates. In order to bridge the gap between localization and diffusive motion, a
                              relaxation time approximation is used. This approximation defines a characteristic time
                              which describes the damping of the velocity correlation function \(C\) according to</p>
                              <p>\[ C(t) = C_0(t) e^{\frac{t}{\tau}} \]</p>
                              <p>where \(C_0\) is some reference velocity correlation. In this case, the wavefunction is
                                   initially localized on a single molecule and spreads to nearby molecules at times
                                   less than \(\tau\). The spread of the electron in time \(t\approx\tau\) can be
                                   described by
                                   the quantity
                              </p>
                              <p> \[ L_0^2(\tau) = \frac{\int e^-\frac{t}{\tau}\Delta x_0^2(t)dt}{\tau} \]</p>
                              <p>which is the transient localization length and \(\Delta x^2(t) = \langle (x(t) -
                                   x(0))^2\rangle\). Using this information, it is possible to express the mobility as
                              </p>
                              <p>\[ \mu = \frac{e}{k_bT}\frac{L_0^2(\tau)}{2\tau} \]</p>
                              <p>Although it is not fully developed here, the temperature relationship can be shown to
                                   have power-law dependence similar to that of the band theory description.<sup>4</sup>
                                   Thus, TLT explains localization of charge and predicts the correct temperature
                                   dependence for small-molecule OSCs.
                                   Additionally, it will be shown later that if the phonon modes are accurately
                                   calculated for a real system, TLT can predict
                                   experimental room-temperature mobilities.

                              <p>According to TLT, accurate prediction of mobility requires an accurate description of
                                   the phonon modes present in a small-molecule semiconductor. Therefore, an
                                   experimental technique to confirm the theoretical phonon modes is necessary.
                                   Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) provides a way to measure
                                   phonons directly throughout the full Brillouin zone.<sup>5</sup> While other
                                   techniques such as Raman or infrared spectroscopy are more widely available, both
                                   techniques suffer from selection rulesâ€”only transitions which correspond to a
                                   particular dipole change are active. Furthermore, these techniques can only measure
                                   phonon modes at the gamma point. This means that several vibrational modes are left
                                   out entirely. Harrelson et al. showed that these missing modes
                                   significantly change the calculated mobility.<sup>6</sup>
                              </p>
                              <p>INS measures the energy and momentum losses from an incident beam of neutrons to the
                                   sample. The amount of interaction between an atom and a neutron is the atomâ€™s neutron
                                   cross section. Hydrogen has the largest cross section at roughly 80 Barns which means
                                   an INS spectrum is primarily showing the motion of the hydrogen atoms. Small-molecule
                                   OSCs are ideal materials for this technique as they often have hydrogen
                                   atoms near the conjugated core.

                              <p>INS provides a neutron density of states, meaning that the intensity tells how active a
                                   particular mode is. The horizontal axis of an INS spectrum is energy transferred (Fig
                                   2). On the high-energy end of the spectrum are modes involving only a few atoms. The
                                   spring constant for these modes is high which places them higher in energy. The low
                                   end of the spectrum is most important for two reasons. First, these modes have a low
                                   spring constant which means they correspond to long-range, slow motions. These are
                                   the modes that TLT predicts to be the most important for charge transport. Second,
                                   they are the modes which are thermally active at room temperature. Only modes with
                                   energy at or below \(k_BT\) are active at a given temperature.

                              <p>The VISION spectrometer at Oak Ridge National Lab has the highest signal-to-noise ratio
                                   of any INS instrument.<sup>7</sup> Its inverted geometry time-of-flight setup allows
                                   the resolution to be constant across the entire energy range. The wide energy range,
                                   high
                                   signal-to-noise ratio, and the fact that small molecule OSCs are

                              <p>An accurate method for calculating phonons is required for accurate calculations of
                                   mobility from TLT. This is traditionally done via the finite displacement supercell
                                   method in
                                   conjunction with density functional theory (DFT).<sup>8</sup> DFT replaces the
                                   multielectron quantum problem with a single electron in a charged field. The
                                   Kohn-Sham theorem is the central assumption of DFT. It states that there exists some
                                   single electron-field density which is identical to the multielectron density. DFT
                                   also approximates the exchange-correlation energy which contains two parts. First is
                                   the energy loss due to the indistinguishability of electrons as defined by the Pauli
                                   principle. Second is the energy increase from electron correlation. DFT is highly
                                   accurate for calculating forces which makes it suitable for phonon calculations.

                              <p>\[ \Phi_{aibj} = \frac{\partial F_{ai}}{\partial U_{bj}} \approx \frac{\Delta
                                   F_{ai}}{\Delta U_{bj}} \]</p>
                              <p>where \(\Phi_{aibj}\) is the spring constant on an atom \(a\) along direction \(i\) due
                                   to a displacement of atom \(b\) along \(j\). \(U_{bj}\) is the displacement of atom
                                   \(b\) in direction \(j\). This is done for each atom in the unit cell to produce the
                                   dynamical matrix which can be used to build the phonon modes. The dynamical matrix is
                                   defined as
                              </p>
                              <p>\[ D_{aibj}(q) = \frac{\Phi_{aibj}}{\sqrt{m_am_b}}e^{iq\cdot (R_{bj}-R_{ai})} \]</p>
                              <p>which is the Fourier transform of the reduced-mass spring constant matrix.
                                   Diagonalization of the dynamical matrix gives the frequencies of each mode and the
                                   atomic displacements. These frequencies and displacements are used in TLT to
                                   determine the mobility via the localization length and relaxation time. These same
                                   values can also be plugged directly into the scattering law for one neutron</p>
                              <p>\[ S(Q,n\omega_s) = \frac{(Q\cdot U_s)^{2n}}{n!}e^{(-Q\cdot U_{total})^2} \]</p>
                              <p>where</p>
                              <p>\[ U_s = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega_s}}e_{ds} \]</p>
                              <p>and \(\omega_s\) is the frequency from the dynamical matrix and \(e_{ds}\) is the
                                   displacement of atom \(d\) within mode \(s\) along each direction.<sup>5</sup> This
                                   provides a way to relate the calculated dynamics back to an experimental process and
                                   confirm that the calculated dynamics are correct.</p>
                              <p>The steps outlined above can be put together to calculate mobility from an experimental
                                   crystal structure. The precise steps
                                   involve first determining the 0K structure by minimizing the energy in DFT. Next, DFT
                                   and Phonopy are used to perform the finite displacement supercell method. These
                                   results can be fed into oclimax, software developed at Oak Ridge National Lab for
                                   simulating a VISION INS spectrum.<sup>10</sup> Finally, the phonon data can be used
                                   to calculate the localization length and the relaxation time necessary to compute the
                                   mobility. This process was able to rank order three substituted -acenes by mobility,
                                   demonstrating its accuracy.

                              <p>While this is a major step forward, there are several limitations associated with this
                                   technique. Foremost, it is centered on DFT which is computationally expensive. This
                                   means that the DFT method is limited to small, highly crystalline systems. Therefore,
                                   it cannot be used to investigate semicrystalline materials such as polymers or
                                   materials with defects. As such, a more scale-friendly technique is necessary.
                                   Density functional tight binding (DFTB+) takes DFT and applies the tight-binding
                                   approximation. This means that DFTB+ is still a quantum simulation technique, but
                                   its cost is
                                   reduced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude.<sup>11</sup> Furthermore, it was
                                   recently shown that the Chebyshev Interaction Model for Efficient Simulation (ChIMES)
                                   can be used as a correction on DFTB+ to improve phonon predictions without
                                   significantly adding to the computational cost.<sup>12</sup> This database contains
                                   computational INS spectra in addition to computed spectra using DFT, DFTB+, and DFTB+
                                   with ChIMES.
